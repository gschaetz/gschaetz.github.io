SchaetzKc has been developing iOS apps since 2008.  Check out our work below.  I know not that many apps for 7 years.  But we had fun making them, that has to count for something.

## Our Mobile Apps  

* <a href="{{ site.url}}/mobile-apps/hot-and-not/">Hot and Not</a>

  > Hot and Not allows you to quickly find what is Hot and Not around you. This is a first of its kind app that determines what is Hot and Not based on social data. It is not based on ratings, but instead is deigned to use social data to determine the places people go to and like.

* <a href="{{ site.url}}/mobile-apps/green-gas/">Green Gas</a>

  > Green Gas Finder allows you to quickly and easily find E85, Electric, Bio-Disel, Compressed Natural Gas, Liquid Natural Gas and Liquid Propane Gas locations across the country with only a few touches. Green Gas Finder search is powered by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's open api.

* <a href="{{ site.url}}/mobile-apps/rps/">Rock, Paper, Scissors!</a>

  > Addictive and fun as you relive your childhood playing this game! RPS: Rock, Paper, Scissors brings the classic game to the iPhone. Includes single player and other modes that utilize the accelerometer making the play fun as you tap the iPhone against your palm three times before seeing the outcome.
