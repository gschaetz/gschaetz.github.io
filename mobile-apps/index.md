SchaetzKc has been developing iOS apps since 2008.  Check out our work below.  I know not that many apps for 7 years.  But we had fun making them, that has to count for something.

## iPhone Apps  

### Green Gas

> Green Gas Finder allows you to quickly and easily find E85, Electric, Bio-Disel, Compressed Natural Gas, Liquid Natural Gas and Liquid Propane Gas locations across the country with only a few touches. Green Gas Finder search is powered by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's open api.

> Holiday 365 is a one stop shop for celebrating the holiday's 365 days a year. Developed with the holiday lover in mind. The application will allow you to have a countdown to all your favorite holidays, find recipes and search for holiday events in your area. The app supports Christmas, New Years, Valentines, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween and Thanksgiving. In addition, Christmas has some special features such as an "25 Days Till Christmas" function that has a different image and saying for the 25 days leading up to Christmas Day. The kids can join in on the fun as well with the letter to Santa feature that will allow them to enter in their name and three gifts that they want. Santa will even respond to their letter =). Have fun and enjoy!

> Hot and Not allows you to quickly find what is Hot and Not around you. This is a first of its kind app that determines what is Hot and Not based on social data. It is not based on ratings, but instead is deigned to use social data to determine the places people go to and like.
